Scripts
========

The pydfnworks package has four Python scripts that assist with compiling, testing, and running the software. These scripts are all in the folder ``dfnWorks/pydfnworks/bin/`` . 

fix_paths.py: fix the paths in the tests folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tests that come with dfnWorks depend on pathnames which vary depending on where dfnWorks is installed. To fix these paths automatically, run the ''fix_paths.py'' script accordingly:

``python fix_paths.py``
